Looks like its important to handle server errors

Better to use server side rendering - good chance to use new react 19 features, server actions?? server components??

could use shadcn components to build quicker

might be good to cache images if apis fail consistently

!!! REVIEW NEXT DOCS TO SEE WHATS NEW FROM LAST TIME USED

features:
1. vehicles - grid of vehicles, with a button to buy vehicles
2. views - might have two views for buyers and sellers. buyer can view all vehicles and seller can confirm perhaps
3 auth - might have to add login to know what screen to show
4. sales - on seller view to track vehicles pending sales
5. page to set fail mode

estimates:
about 2-3 hours to build screens? 1 more hour for optimizing stuff?
